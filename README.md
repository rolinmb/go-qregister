Referencing other repos of mine to implement a quantum register in golang.

Probably not going to go as far in this repo as 'py-qregister' repo because that code is just more thorough (i.e. I already implemented a qudit qlu) and python less verbose

Build and run from root: go build -C src -o main && ./src/main
